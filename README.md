# VA_v1
This is a simple voice assistant using the rasa framework for the natural language understanding part
Text-to-speech, speech-to-text and the execution of simple action are all created with python tools

What the VA should be able to do:
- tell Weather (today or tomorow) locationvdependent
- Set a timer
- translate from english into any other language
- create calendar event in outlook calendar
- create a list with items in them

This project is a bit messy and only works on Windows
What might interest you are the files in /data, since you can use them to train your own chatbot,
as well as the /actions folder which has some scripts in them which execute all the above listed tasks
